“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.

Now a days, just about everything requires some form of programming.
We have glasses, smartwatch, smartphone, car, computer, quadcopter, light, refrigerator.
Who use one or more of these apps? All of it was made using programming.

But, what’s programming?

Programming is basically explaining to a computer what you want it to do for you.
It`s about humanity and help people.

Coding is something that can be learned and Nobody have to be a genius to do it.
We don`t have to be a genius to learn english. We don`t have to be a genius to play something.
You just have to start small. You need to be determined.
Everything is practice.

The first program everybody write is the famous “Hello World!”
So let's code.

Programming has been changing the world, so we can do it and make the world a better place.
Thank you.
